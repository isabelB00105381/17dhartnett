		<p>Batteries are the engine that drives your vaporizer. In order to enjoy blowing those tasty clouds, you need a battery that is 
		both powerful and long lasting. Most importantly, you want to be able to vape with peace of mind.
		When choosing the best batteries for vaping, the three most important things you should consider are output, capacity and safety.
		Mods are powered by either a built-in pack or a removable battery. Advanced vapers prefer the latter because they are more versatile
		and are safer to charge. The 18650 has become the battery of choice when it comes to vaping, and modern mod designs are often based on this configuration.</p>
